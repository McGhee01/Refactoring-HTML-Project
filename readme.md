For this assignment, I was instructed to refactor the entire webpage and write a summary for all changes made during the assignment given. But first, allow me to explain the term refactor.The definiton of refactor derives from the term code refactor. Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code-- changing the refactoring--without changing it's external bahavior. In simplest terms, code refactoring or refactoring is to reduce or make changes to the code internally, while anything external unchnged or simply making necessary changes to a code script. The process of sych can be as listed:

- Reducing excessive line usage

- Grouping like section, headers, footers, and other classes together to make coding script look neater than it's original form.

- The process of putting Semantics to replace different tags.

In this paragraph, I will explain step by step how I refactored the coding script completely. First, I viewed the code script and noticed there a were an ample amount of <div> tags listed throughout the entire script of code. The question that went wild was, "What does the <div> tag mean and is it necessary?" Thirsty to find the answer, I searched on Google to educate myself on what <div> tags means. The answer was revealed to me as my trust in Google never fails. I seaerched for my answer ona website www.w3schools.com provided by Google. W3Schols states, " The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag!" Being educated on the mystery tag, I began to test theories on different semantic tags to replace the <div> tags seen throughout the code scrpit. I replaced all the <div> tags with two new tags, named summary and aside. These two tags are used to explain the different types of texts in the website I am tasked to refactor. The summary tag is used for the bodies of text on the website. The bodies of text are summary of their corresponding headers: search engine optimization, online reputation, and social media marketing. While the aside tag was used for the caption and text seen on the far right of the webpage. Once I replaced <div> with aside and summary, I opened my default Browser to see if any incorrect were made. As a result, everything was fine as if I never touched at all.

Next, I began to notice while testing everything was running smoothly in the website I seen something was terribly incorrect. The teab labeled, " Search Engine Optimization" wasn't clickable to perform it's action like the other two tabs shown. To fix the mistake, I looked back at my index.html and noticed somthing wasn't right that appeared to be correct with the other two tabs. Once the issue was resolved, I continued my task of refactoring of finding anymore issues. The remaining refactoring was work done to simplify the amount of lined used, modifications and updates.Reducing lines, modifications to class sections and images (inputting alt) for each and links for ID from lines 16-21 were added.
Finally, refactoring in the style.css file was to reduce line usage and combine like sections in one to reduce excessive line usage.
